Problem Statement : Movies - One trailer per movie doesn't quite cover everyone's favorite parts. Can AI generate trailers with different highlights for varying demographic needs?

Our approach:   
We will begin by inputting a movie along with its subtitles. Using sentiment analysis, we’ll process the subtitles to identify the emotional tone of each scene. Based on the target genre, we’ll select and extract scenes that align with the desired mood, such as comedic moments for a comedy genre or intense sequences for action. Finally, we’ll compile these selected scenes into a cohesive, genre-specific trailer that reflects the requested style.
